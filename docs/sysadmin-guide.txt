System Admin guide
==============

This guide covers the administration features of CHIMS, such as managing
users, resource models and datasets. These features are available via the web user interface to
a user with sysadmin rights. The guide assumes familiarity with the
:doc:`userguide/Using CHIMS`.

Certain administration tasks are not available through the web UI but need
access to the server where CHIMS is installed. These include the range of
configuration options using the site's "config" file, which will be documented in
maintainers guide.

.. warning::

    A sysadmin user can access and edit any organizations group, view and change user
    details, and permanently delete datasets, resource models. You should carefully consider who has
    access to a sysadmin account on your CHIMS system.

---------------------------
Creating a system admin account
---------------------------

Normally, a sysadmin account is created as part of the process of setting up
CHIMS. If one does not already exist, you will need to create a sysadmin user,
or give sysadmin rights to an existing user. To do this requires access to the
server. If another organization is hosting CHIMS, you will need to ask them to create a sysadmin user.

Adding more sysadmin accounts is done in the same way. It can be done via
the web UI.


-----------------------------------
Managing user groups and resources
-----------------------------------

A sysadmin user has full access to user accounts, organizations and datasets (resources).
For example, you have access to every organization, group as if you were a member of
that organization. Thus most management operations are done in exactly the same
way as in the normal web interface.

For example, to add or delete users to an organization groups, change a user's role in
the group, delete the organization or edit its description, etc, visit
the site's administration page.
